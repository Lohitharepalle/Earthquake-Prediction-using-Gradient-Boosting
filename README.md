# Earthquake Prediction using Gradient Boosting
The aim of this project is to predict the earthquakes using gradient boosting. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, a Python library for creating GUI applications, and utilizes XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting library, for predicting earthquakes.

Earthquake prediction is a challenging task due to the complexity and unpredictability of seismic events. Traditional methods have relied on analyzing historical data and identifying patterns to forecast earthquakes. However, recent advancements in machine learning techniques, particularly gradient boosting, have shown promise in improving the accuracy of earthquake prediction models. Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak predictive models to create a robust and accurate model. In the context of earthquake prediction, gradient boosting algorithms can effectively capture intricate patterns and correlations between various geophysical features, leading to more reliable predictions.

##Problem Statement
To reduce the damage caused by earthquakes, we wanted to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict earthquake events using GNSS data. This is important because earthquakes can cause significant damage to infrastructure and loss of life, and accurate prediction can help to mitigate their impact and save lives. This model uses Gradient Boosting and is able to identify patterns and trends in the GNSS data that are indicative of impending earthquakes and provide timely alerts to relevant authorities and the public.

##Modules
The project is divided into four different phases
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Training the model
4. Evaluation and Prediction
